# Calculator
*The Odin Project - Calculator Project*

## Description
This is a basic calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides a users input. This can be imputed through a keyboard or the user interface that was created. The user interface is inspired by the aesthetics of the science fiction genre.

The technologies used are HTML, Javascript, and CSS. This was because the goal of the project was to practice using everything that I learned in the Odin Project Fundamentals section.

Through coding this project I managed to cement everything that I learned. I am happy that I managed to make something actually work on a website given that I have not been doing this for very long. I think some future things that could be added would be extra polish and visual shine to make the calculator feel more sci-fi feeling such as 3D dials and actual glowing lights or making the calculator sit in 3D space.
