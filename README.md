# Calculator

_Calculator Project_

## üìù Description

This is a basic calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides a user's input. This can be inputted through a keyboard or the user interface that was created. The user interface is inspired by the aesthetics of the science fiction genre. The technologies used are HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

## ‚ú® Features

- Basic calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Extra hidden logic to match normal calculators
- Button input and keyboard input

## üå± Context

The goal of the project was to practice the basic core fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in a web application. It was created as the final project in a Web Development basics program before moving on to learning more advanced topics. It took around 15 hours to complete.

## üèÜ Wins and Challenges

### Wins

- Through coding this project I managed to cement all the topics that I learned. I am happy that I managed to make something actually work on a website given that I have not been doing this for very long.
- Managing to style the calculator to be more fun than a standard calculator was fun and I'm happy with how it turned out.

### Challenges

- Managing the 'hidden' calculator logic was a bit challenging. For example: after a result is displayed, if a number is typed, it will clear the previous output and start a new calculation. This could have been resolved had I planned out the code better when I first started. In the future, more focus will be put on code planning.

## üöÄ Future Roadmap

- Add more style and customization to make the calculator feel more sci-fi feeling such as 3D dials and actual glowing lights or making the calculator sit in 3D space.
- Extra calculator functions such as parentheses, log, and power.
- Color customization
- Complete mobile formatting
- Refactor the code to follow Functional Programming Paradigm
